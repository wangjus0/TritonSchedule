# TritonSchedule backend

This package serves the TritonSchedule API and runs the Class Planner catalog and Rate My Professors ingestion jobs.

```

`dist/` is generated and must not be committed.
Its structure mirrors `src/` directly, so the server entry point is `dist/server.js` rather than `dist/src/server.js`.
Tests stay outside `src/` and are never emitted into the production build.

## Development

Install dependencies from this directory with `npm ci`.

Run the backend with automatic restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The repository-level `npm run dev` starts both the frontend and this backend in watch mode.
Use the repository-level `npm run setup` first to create environment files, align the frontend and backend API keys, and install all workspace dependencies.
The root [`README.md`](../README.md#environment-variables) documents every environment variable and the optional local Supabase setup.

## Course search and TSS metadata

`GET /course?course=<query>&term=<term>` responds with `{ data: Course[] }` and returns one course record for each matching primary section.
Primary sections include lecture, independent study, and seminar instruction types, including the Class Planner codes `LE`, `IN`, and `SE`.
Lecture, discussion, and lab entries retain the display fields `Days`, `Time`, and `Location` and may include the following Class Planner identifiers:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SectionId` | Class Planner section identifier. |
| `SectionRef` | Term-qualified Class Planner section reference. |
| `SectionCode` | Display code for the section. |
| `EventPackageIds` | TSS event packages that contain the section. |

Course records may also include `TssPackageUrls`, which maps event package IDs to their official TSS booking URLs for that primary section.
When Class Planner provides a module route instead of event-package deep links, the record exposes it as `TssFallbackUrl`.
These fields are optional because not every course or section combination has a valid TSS destination.
The frontend enables **Open in TSS** only after it resolves one package shared by the selected lecture, discussion, and lab, or a valid module fallback, and validates the exact HTTPS `tss.ucsd.edu/fiori` route before opening a new tab.

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm start
```

The first three commands validate source and test code.
The build command clears stale output and compiles production code only.
The start command runs the compiled server from `dist/server.js`.
Use `npm run test:watch` for interactive test development and `npm run clean` to remove generated build output.

## Catalog ingestion

Apply the Supabase migrations before running ingestion so the atomic catalog refresh and private ingestion audit functions are available.
The command requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`:

```bash
npm run ingest -- --term=FA26 --professors=auto
```

`--term` is optional and otherwise lets Class Planner select its current term.
`--professors` accepts the following modes and defaults to `auto`:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Refresh ratings on Sunday in `America/Chicago`, or retry after the latest requested professor phase failed or completed with warnings. |
| `always` | Refresh ratings during this run. |
| `never` | Publish only the catalog. |

The job stages and atomically publishes a non-empty catalog before requesting professor ratings.
Professor requests use the Rate My Professors GraphQL API with a 30-second timeout, at most three attempts for network, rate-limit, and server failures, serialized requests, and longer exponential backoff after rate limits.
Partial professor failures update successful ratings, preserve previously stored ratings for failed requests, emit workflow warnings, and record `succeeded_with_warnings`.
If the school lookup fails or no professor request succeeds, the command exits unsuccessfully after recording the professor-phase failure; it does not roll back the published catalog or replace existing ratings.

Each run writes counts, warnings, publication state, and the workflow URL to `private.catalog_ingestion_runs` through service-role-only functions.
Starting a run rejects overlap with another active run, marks runs older than four hours as failed, and removes audit and completed or failed catalog-refresh records older than 90 days.

## Deployment

Vercel uses `src/app.ts` directly as its Express entry point.
The app is exported separately from `src/server.ts` so serverless deployment does not create a long-lived listener, while local and standalone deployments can still use `npm start`.

The GitHub Actions workflow in [`.github/workflows/nightly-ingestion.yml`](../.github/workflows/nightly-ingestion.yml) runs catalog ingestion outside the Vercel request lifecycle.
It runs nightly at 3:17 AM in `America/Chicago` and also supports manual term and professor-mode inputs.
Manual dispatches preselect `always` so an operator-requested run refreshes professor ratings by default, while scheduled runs continue using `auto`.
Configure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as repository Actions secrets before enabling or dispatching it.
